In the last three months, I have worked with Indonesia’s Labour Force Survey (Sakernas) data for my study assignments. Honestly, it’s been a tiring process because the variable names change every few years, and some variables, such as education, income, KBJI, and KBLI, have different structures in different years. Yes, there are documents from BPS (Indonesia’s statistics agency), but the documents are also different for every year. There is also an invaluable guidebook from the World Bank (https://datamenko.ekon.go.id/files/handbooks/A%20guide%20to%20working%20with%20Indonesian%20survey%20data%20-%20Sakernas.pdf), but it only covers until 2013. I recommend everyone to read that guidebook. Here, I only want to write all the things that, based on my experience, need to be taken care of when working with Sakernas data from 2011-2024, while that guidebook has a more comprehensive scope, as the name suggests.

## Changes in Variable Names
The variable names change almost every year. Here are the list of important variables and how they change over years.
