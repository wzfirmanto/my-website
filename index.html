  <h1 class="post-title">Halo!</h1>

  <p>I'm Wahyu Zuli Firmanto, currently pursuing a Master of Public Policy at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore. My interests focus on development economics, particularly in labor markets, education, and industrial policy. Before joining the program, I co-founded and managed an education company in Indonesia for seven years, where I gained firsthand insights into labor markets and human capital development.</p>

  <p>In my free time, I enjoy activities that connect me with the community and nature. I've been involved in organizing free classes and a street library for kids in my hometown. These days, I spend my free moments trekking and cycling as a way to recharge from schoolwork.</p>

  <p>This website is where I document my public policy journey - <a href="/blog">from academic insights to personal reflections</a> - and showcase <a href="/portfolio">my portfolio</a>. Thanks for visitingâ€”hope you find something here that interests you!</p>
